# Fractals Simulation

This is a basic program where you can see step-by-step the implemented fractals behaviour.

Until now, there are only these fractals:
-Sierpinski triangle.

It's used by running the program and writing on the console to see the next step or the last one.
To see the next step, type next and press enter.
To see the last step, type last and press enter.

If nothing is written and enter is pressed, the program will end.
